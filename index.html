    <h3>working time</h3>
    <p>Jul 2019 - Jul 2022, Working as a patent examiner in Beijing Patent Examination Cooperation Center of China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), Fujian Sub-center.
    </p>
    <br>
    <li>
        <h3>job discription</h3>
      <p>Patent examiners examine the patent applications submitted by applicants to the Patent Office of CNIPA (China National Intellectual Property Administration) by the Chinese Patent Law. This position requires examiners to have a background in scienceï¼Œengineering, and law, as well as the ability to learn quickly to deal with cutting-edge and interdisciplinary patent applications.

        <h3>why I choice this job</h3>
        <p>
            When I was in college, China was in a period of economic transition, advocating the strategy of strengthening the country through science and technology. The government and enterprises were increasingly encouraging and emphasizing innovation, and many companies emerged in China that relied on technological innovation to capture the product market, such as Huawei, ZTE, DJI, and others. Meanwhile, China's intellectual property protection industry has seen a leap forward in this context, and I keenly observed this phenomenon. In 2018, I saw in the news that the U.S. federal court ruled on the Apple lawsuit against Samsung for patent infringement, ruling that Samsung Electronics infringed on Apple's design and other technology patents for iPhone products in 2012, and Samsung eventually had to pay $539 million in royalties to Apple. Apple and Samsung have been fighting patent wars worldwide since 2011, and the time consumed and money invested is enormous, making me realize the importance of patent protection for technology innovation companies. With the progress and development of technology, patent wars similar to Apple and Samsung's will undoubtedly continue to emerge in the future. The demand for high-end talents in patent protection will also increase, which is an excellent employment opportunity for practitioners. I entered the IP protection industry, hoping to become a top expert.

        <h3>what I get from this job</h3>
        <p>
            I received systematic training on intellectual property rights. During my three-year working life, I have learned Chinese patent law and the patent protection system of other countries in the world, and I have become familiar with the examination process of Chinese invention patents and the PCT international application process, and know how to use patent databases and literature databases in different countries in the world and had robust patent search and analysis skills. The patent examination work gives me a deeper understanding of China's patent examination and protection system and other countries worldwide.
